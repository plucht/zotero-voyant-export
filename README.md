# Zotero Voyant Export

Export your Zotero collections to Voyant.

[Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) is "a web-based text analysis and reading
environment" that lets you visualize the content of a text
corpus. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a "a free, easy-to-use tool to help
you collect, organize, cite, and share your research sources." This translator
aims to help those with preexisting Zotero collections get a new view on their
data via Voyant.

## Requirements

* [Zotero Standalone 5.0][zot] or higher; note that **the beta will irreversibly
upgrade your database** (!), so take care to backup beforehand.
* a collection containing full texts (as PDFs, HTML snapshots, etc.)

## Installation

Download the latest [release][release] of the XPI (click "Save Link As..." if in
Firefox). Then open Zotero Standalone and select the Tools menu -> Add-ons.
Click the gear icon in the upper right and select "Install Add-On From File...";
open the XPI file you just saved.

## Usage

Right-click on the collection you wish to analyze. Select "Export Collection to
Voyant..." and choose a save location for the corpus as a zip file.

Upload the resulting zip to [voyant-tools.org](voyant-tools.org) (or
to [your local Voyant server][local-voyant] -- for collections larger than a
handful of documents, you'll probably want to host locally). You should then be
able to see your corpus in the default Voyant view.

## Development

This is a work-in-progress. Please see the [initial release project][project]
for an indication of what has been/will be done. Help is very welcome!

### Build

Run `make` to create a new XPI.

Signing can be done with `make sign`, if you have the `JWT_ISSUER` and
`JWT_SECRET` environment variables set. The `update.rdf` will be signed with
[uhura](http://www.softlights.net/projects/mxtools/) (make sure you have the
private key file path as `UHURA_PEM_FILE` in your environment).

### Tests

Run the tests using Firefox Nightly, e.g.:

```
jpm test -b /Applications/Nightly.app/
```
